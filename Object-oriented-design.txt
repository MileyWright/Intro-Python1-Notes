Object Oriented Programming
    a way of writing computer programs to use “objects” to model data and behaviors.
    - Model objects with classes
        - attributes
        - methods
    - Programming paradigm
    - Allows us to establish relationships b/w objects

Classes
    - [nouns] are used to model real-world objects
    - Think of them as blueprints to make multiple instances of the same object
    - They contain:
        - Attributes [adjectives]
        - Methods [verbs]

Method
    - One or more lines of code
    - Defines a specific behavior or action
    - may return a value

Self
    - Indicates class-level variable
        - scope is entire class

class Animal:
    """A simple example class"""
    def __init( name, hunger, diet):
        # the constructor
        self.name = name
        self.hunger = hunger
        self.diet = diet
    
    def eat(self, food):
        # a method
        if food > 0 and hunger < 25:
            hunger += food
