# Question from the Project

# Write a program that accepts user input of the form
#   `14_cal.py [month] [year]`
# and does the following:
#  - If the user doesn't specify any input, your program should
#    print the calendar for the current month. The 'datetime'
#    module may be helpful for this.
#  - If the user specifies one argument, assume they passed in a
#    month and render the calendar for that month of the current year.
#  - If the user specifies two arguments, assume they passed in
#    both the month and the year. Render the calendar for that
#    month and year.
#  - Otherwise, print a usage statement to the terminal indicating
#    the format that your program expects arguments to be given.
#    Then exit the program.
# Note: the user should provide argument input (in the initial call to run the file) and not 
# prompted input. Also, the brackets around year are to denote that the argument is
# optional, as this is a common convention in documentation.
# This would mean that from the command line you would call `python3 14_cal.py 4 2015` to 
# print out a calendar for April in 2015, but if you omit either the year or both values, 
# it should use todayâ€™s date to get the month and year.
